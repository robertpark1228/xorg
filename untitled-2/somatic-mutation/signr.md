# SignR

Motivation: Cancer is an evolutionary process driven by continuous acquisition of genetic variations in individual cells. The diversity and complexity of somatic mutational processes is a conspicuous feature orchestrated by DNA damage agents and repair processes, including exogenous or endogenous mutagen exposures, defects in DNA mismatch repair and enzymatic modification of DNA. The identification of the underlying mutational processes is central to understanding of cancer origin and evolution.
